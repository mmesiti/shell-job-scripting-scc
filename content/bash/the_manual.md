# Understanding Bash manual

How do you retrieve some 

The Bash manual is well written 
and with a little help 
it can be a very good source 
where to look up for *clarifications*.

- How to search for any text in the man pages?
- Use proper names for bash features, 
  so that you can search for them in the bash manual.
- For Bash builtins (`set`,`export`,`shopt` etc.), you can use `help`.
