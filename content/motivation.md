# Why should one learn the shell? 

Advantages of using the shell for scientific research:

- Working with **HPC**:

  - *Bash* scripts are the best way to launch jobs on a supercomputer
  - the shell is the best supported way to interact with a supercomputer
- Bash scripting helps with **Reproducibility** 
  which is paramount for scientists
 
General advantages of Command Line Interfaces compared to Graphical User Interfaces:

- Robust automation
- Easy Transition between interactive work/exploration and automation

## Why not?

For some tasks it might be better 
to use other tools, 
because of:

- obscure syntax 
- focus on interactivity and writability, 
  not on readability and ease of maintenance
- lack of complex data structures
