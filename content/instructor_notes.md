# Instructor notes
## Rationale

Everything covered here
is also covered at length 
in countless other places on the internet
and can also be retrieved on a whim with a LLM,
so why repeat it here?
1. As with a lot of things in teaching,
the goal is to first of all cover 
the *unknown unknowns* of the student;
2. To guide the students
through those important ideas
that are also too hard to approach alone,
and that would not be learned 
without guidance.

## Known issues

The split between "Intermediate" and "Advanced" 
is somewhat arbitrary, 
and only due to lesson time limits
(which themselves are a result of assessed importance of the topics).
The guiding principle here is 
to talk about the most useful things first,
and assume that the more obscure a feature is, 
the less the return on investment is going to be.

Problems can and will be discussed 
using the issue feature 
on the service where this documentation is hosted.
