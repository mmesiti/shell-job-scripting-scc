# Shell and Job Scripting course notes

This course is intended to teach 
how to use the bash shell efficiently
to researchers using a HPC cluster,
with a goal-oriented approach
(backward lesson design,
popularized by Greg Wilson's 
[Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/)
and references therein).

Everything covered here
is also covered at length 
in countless other places on the internet
and can also be retrieved on a whim with a LLM,
so why repeat it here?
1. As with a lot of things in teaching,
the goal is to first of all cover 
the *unknown unknowns* of the student, 
2. To guide the students
through those important ideas
that are also too hard to approach alone,
and that would not be learned 
without guidance.

Suggestions/criticism are welcome,
so feel free to open issues 
and pull requests 
to this repository.

It is based on/inspired by the following sources,

- The already existing slides and the exercises of the HPC-DIC courses by SCC/SCS
- The "Shell scripts and tips" course [by NRIS](https://training.pages.sigma2.no/tutorials/shell-scripts-and-tips/)
- The [linux shell tutorial](https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/linux-shell/) by Aalto Science IT department (very detailed course, goes deeper than what we are trying to do here).
- The software carpentry [Shell Novice Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
- The Bash manual.
