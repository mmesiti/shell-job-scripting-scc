## What is a Bash script?

- A Bash *script* is a plain text file 
  containing a list of commands,
  of the kind that could be launched interactively 
  in a Bash *shell*. 

- It is a (simple form of a) program.

- Typically, a bash script will 
  call other programs
  "orchestrate" their operations together,
  provide them with data,
  organize the data movements.

- The other programs will typically be written
  in languages that are more suitable to scientific computing,
  but they can also be other bash scripts.
