# Why should one learn the shell? 

## Advantages

General advantages of Command Line Interfaces compared to Graphical User Interfaces:

- Robust automation
- Easy Transition between interactive work/exploration and automation

Advantages of using the Bash shell for scientific research:

- Working with **HPC**:

  - *Bash* scripts are the best way to launch jobs on a supercomputer
  - the shell is the best supported way to interact with a supercomputer

- Bash scripting helps with **Reproducibility** 
  which is paramount for scientists
- it is convenient to call other programs, 
  including the ones from the UNIX ecosystem
- many built-in features
- portability

## Limitations 

For some tasks it might be better 
to use other tools, 
because of:

- obscure syntax 
- focus on interactivity and writability, 
  not on readability and ease of maintenance
- lack of complex data structures

Moreover, it is unsuitable for:
- heavy-duty math operations
- Extensive file operations

But these limitations can be avoided 
by using programs written in other languages.
