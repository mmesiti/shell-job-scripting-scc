But they should be reworked a little.\n  It took 30 minutes more or less\n- The bash manual did not take much time. \n  Someone really tried following along.\n  The exercise about expansions should be shortened,\n  maybe rephrase a little\n  (what are expansions?)\n- During the control flow episode I had the impression that people were following,\n  but perhaps something could be cut here \n  (the discussion about \u0026\u0026 and || for example)\n- In the composability section quite some things should be cut\n  perhaps the discussion about `export` should be shortened.\n  The exercise (and the notions that it exposes)\n  is interesting, but it is not really useful content.\n  - Functions are more important, they should go first.\n  - scripts and command line arguments, and their similarity to functions,\n    are important. This time I have improvised a discussion of that. \n    Scope maybe not that important? \n    Rephrase with, like\n    \"Variables defined in a function are visible outside \n    unless you use **local**.\"\n  - xargs could be removed (or moved to extra),\n    it has a too obscure syntax.\n- Interactive tips and tricks makes sense\n- Again, the text manipulation notebook was not touched. \n  It is possibly time to remove it?","files":null}]}
